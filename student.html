      <p>
        You're a regular college student, always scrolling—between classes, at
        night, even during meals. Lately, your feed feels off. It’s louder, more
        extreme. Posts seem designed to rile you up or suck you in. You start to
        question: should you keep trusting what the app shows you, or take the
        time to look elsewhere and hear different sides?

      <div class="choices">
        <a href="student_1_trust.html" class="btn">
          Trust the Feed: Stick with what the app gives you. It’s fast,
          familiar, and always keeps you scrolling.</a

          even if it takes more effort.
