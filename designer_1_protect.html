      <p>
        Engagement drops a bit, but users seem happier. Feedback is
        positive—less stress, more control. However, the management isn’t
        thrilled. Profits took a hit, and now you're in a meeting with them,
        expected to explain yourself. You can stick to your principles or give
        in to pressure.
