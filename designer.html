      <h1>Algorithm Designer</h1>
      <p>
        You sit at your desk, screens casting a faint glow in the darkened
        office, endless data scrolling past. You know the algorithms inside-out,
        but your voice rarely reaches those calling the shots. Today, marketing
        demands tweaks to maximize user engagement—more scrolling, more clicks,
        more ads—but you're uneasy. You've seen firsthand the toll that constant
        screen time can take on mental health. The decision rests with you.
